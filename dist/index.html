  	<h2 id='wah'>What Are Hamsters?</h2>
  	<p id='ham_intro'>
  		<strong>Hamsters</strong> are rodents (order Rodentia) belonging to the subfamily Cricetinae, which contains 19 species classified in seven genera. They have become established as popular small pets. The best-known species of hamster is the golden or Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), which is the type most commonly kept as pets. Other hamster species commonly kept as pets are the three species of dwarf hamster, Campbell's dwarf hamster (Phodopus campbelli), the winter white dwarf hamster (Phodopus sungorus) and the Roborovski hamster (Phodopus roborovskii).</br>
  		Hamsters are more crepuscular than nocturnal and, in the wild, remain underground during the day to avoid being caught by predators. They feed primarily on seeds, fruits, and vegetation, and will occasionally eat burrowing insects.Physically, they are stout-bodied with distinguishing features that include elongated cheek pouches extending to their shoulders, which they use to carry food back to their burrows, as well as a short tail and fur-covered feet.</br>
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		<strong class='subsec' >Fertility</strong></br>
  		Hamsters become fertile at different ages depending on their species. Both Syrian and Russian hamsters mature quickly and can begin reproducing at a young age (4â€“5 weeks), whereas Chinese hamsters will usually begin reproducing at two to three months of age, and Roborovskis at three to four months of age. The female's reproductive life lasts about 18 months, but male hamsters remain fertile much longer. Females are in estrus about every four days, which is indicated by a reddening of genital areas, a musky smell, and a hissing, squeaking vocalisation she will emit if she believes a male is nearby.</br>
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		When seen from above, a sexually mature female hamster has a trim tail line; a male's tail line bulges on both sides. This might not be very visible in all species. Male hamsters typically have very large testes in relation to their body size. Before sexual maturity occurs, it is more difficult to determine a young hamster's sex. When examined, female hamsters have their anal and genital openings close together, whereas males have these two holes farther apart (the penis is usually withdrawn into the coat and thus appears as a hole or pink pimple).</br>
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		<strong class='subsec'>Gestation and fecundity</strong></br>
  		Syrian hamsters are seasonal breeders and will produce several litters a year with several pups in each litter. The breeding season is from April to October in the Northern Hemisphere, with two to five litters of one to 13 young being born after a gestation period of 16 to 23 days.[19] Dwarf hamsters breed all through the year. Gestation lasts 16 to 18 days for Syrian hamsters, 18 to 21 days for Russian hamsters, 21 to 23 days for Chinese hamsters and 23 to 30 for Roborovski hamsters. The average litter size for Syrian hamsters is about seven pups, but can be as great as 24, which is the maximum number of pups that can be contained in the uterus. Campbell's dwarf hamsters tend to have four to eight pups in a litter, but can have up to 13. Winter white hamsters tend to have slightly smaller litters, as do Chinese and Roborovski hamsters.</br>
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		<strong class='subsec'>Intersexual aggression and cannibalism</strong></br>
  		Female Chinese and Syrian hamsters are known for being aggressive toward males if kept together for too long after mating. In some cases, male hamsters can die after being attacked by a female. If breeding hamsters, separation of the pair after mating is recommended, or they will attack each other.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		Female hamsters are also particularly sensitive to disturbances while giving birth, and may even eat their own young if they think they are in danger, although sometimes they are just carrying the pups in their cheek pouches. If captive female hamsters are left for extended periods (three weeks or more) with their litter, they may cannibalize the litter, so the litter must be removed by the time the young can feed and drink independently.

  	<h2 id='food'> What do hamsters eat?</h2>
  	<p>
  		<ul>
  			<li>Fresh, clean drinking water continuously. Check the water bottle daily for leaks and/or blockages. Change their water regularly and clean the bottle and nozzle properly to avoid contamination. </li>
  			<li><strong>Water preferably from a bottle with a <em>valveless sipper tube</em>.</strong>
  			Hamsters aren't able to apply strong suction so may have difficulty overcoming the resistance from the water flow in traditional `ball-valve' sipper tubes.</li>
  			Provided the sipper is of a relatively small diameter/manufactured with a pinch in the segment, it will be easier to drink from than one with a mechanical obstruction in it.</li>
  			<li>This may be particularly important for young/old/sick hamsters.</li>

  		<ol>
  			<li>A good quality, balanced diet containing all essential nutrients and minerals.a compound pelleted ration or mixture of different seeds.</li>
  			<li> Commercial rations are formulated to meet their biological needs. Hamsters naturally eat a mixture of seeds/cereals/insect larvae/larger insects e.g. crickets. Food placed in flat dishes or directly on the cage floor. If in a dish, expect them to turn it over to transfer the contents to their larder.</li>
  			<li>They carry food in their cheek pouches and can be seen retreating from their food with bulging cheeks. They like to sit up and hold pieces of food to gnaw. </li>
  			<li>Variety. Small quantities of greens/cleaned root vegetables/pieces of fruit e.g. apples can supplement the ration. Don't give grapes or rhubarb as these can be poisonous to rodents. 
  			Wet/powdered food <strong id='imp'>only</strong> on the advice of a vet e.g. because of dental problems.</li>
  		</ol>
    		<em>**To avoid sudden dietary changes, or food that becomes stale, as this can upset their stomach.
    		The amount they eat and drink monitoring. If food consumption falls, the faeces become moist or their hind-quarters become soiled, talk to your vet immediately.</em>

  	<h2 id="care">How to take care of a hamster?</h2>
  	 <h3>Before You Begin</h3>
  	 	<p>Before you buy any pet, make sure you have a home set up for it to minimize the stress of adjusting to a new home. Hamsters have a specific set of needs: they require exercise and mental stimulation, as well as a well-ventilated cage with a place to hide. Your hamster will also need a varied diet with a mix of store-bought food and fresh food. Make sure you know what your new pet can (and can't) eat.</br>
  	 	What You Need</br>

		You'll need to provide your pet hamster with a few essential supplies, including:
			<ul>

    			<li>Cage</li>
    			<li>Bedding and nesting material</li>
   				<li>Food</li>
    			<li>Food dish</li>
    			<li>Water bottle</li>
    			<li>Wheel</li>
    			<li>House or hideout</li>
    			<li>Toys</li>
    		</ul>
		Choose the Right Hamster Cage</br>
		Get a cage that is large enough for your hamster, escape-proof, and easy to clean.2 While the modular cages with tubes are fun, they can be difficult to clean and are poor for ventilation (and the tubes can be too small for some Syrian hamsters). Never underestimate the ability of a hamster to escape, as it can fit through pretty small spaces and chew through plastic walls surprisingly quickly.</br>
		If you are getting a Syrian hamster, keep in mind that many cages marketed for hamsters will be on the small side. If you are getting a dwarf hamster, be aware that they can often squeeze through the bars of an average-sized hamster cage. You'll want to fully clean the hamster cage once a week. Safely remove the hamster and place it in a secure location while the cage is being cleaned.
	 <h3>Add Hamster Bedding and Nesting Material</h3>
	 Avoid cedar and pine-wood chips for bedding for your hamster; the odor can be irritating to hamsters' respiratory systems. Aspen is a safer option if you prefer to use wood bedding, but many people prefer to use paper or other fiber-based beddings. Hamsters love a cozy nest for napping; the cotton nesting materials found at pet stores is unnecessary and can cause problems if eaten or if it gets wrapped around their toes. Shredded toilet paper or facial tissues are excellent nesting materials and are economical as well. Bedding materials can be cleaned out and replaced during the weekly cage cleaning.

	 <h3>Choose Hamster Food and Containers</h3>

	   Pick a good quality food for your hamster. Pelleted foods offer a good nutritional balance and for many hamsters are a better option than loose food mixes. With a loose mix (seeds and other items), your hamster might pick out what it likes and leave what it doesn't, which could result in a dietary imbalance or an overweight hamster. A pelleted mix can be supplemented with a variety of other items, including fresh vegetables. Hamsters should be fed once a day. Remove any fresh food that has not been eaten within a few hours.</br>
	   A shallow, small but heavy bowl (anything that won't be easily tipped over) is ideal as a food dish for your hamster. A small ceramic or porcelain crock is a great option, as they are sturdy and won't be chewed up. You don't need to get fancy and buy a special hamster dish, but make sure whatever you choose won't be chewed up the next day.</br>
	   A small hanging water bottle with a stainless steel spout and ball is the most commonly used water container for hamsters. A bowl is too likely to be spilled, dirtied, or filled with bedding. Make sure your hamster always has fresh water.
     <h3>Offer Exercise Options</h3>
       Hamsters love to run and need the exercise, so purchase the largest, best-quality exercise wheel you can. It should have a solid surface for running and ideally no cross supports (that might catch a leg or neck). Look for one that mounts on the side of the cage. Make sure the wheel is quiet as well since hamsters run at night. A small amount of vegetable oil dripped onto the wheel axis may aid in keeping the wheel quiet.</br>
       In addition to a wheel, your hamster should have a variety of things to chew on and climb on. Hamsters need a lot of stimulation and exercise, or they can become bored. Bored hamsters start trying to chew through everything, with escape being the likely outcome. Plenty of hamster-safe items exist in the pet store, or you can use toilet paper tubes and tissue boxes to make toys for your hamster.
     <h3>Consider a Hamster House or Hide Box</h3>

       Your hamster will appreciate a private getaway for sleeping. A house or hide box can be as simple as a small cardboard box (it will have to be replaced often but it is economical), a plastic hide box (it may be chewed up), a wooden box (it may be chewed or get soiled and smelly), or other things like a half coconut shell or a small clay plant pot. Upside-down plastic food storage containers such as a butter tub can be used if you cut out a door for your hamster (making sure there are no sharp edges).
     <h3>Preventing Problems With Your Hamster During Care</h3>

	   Hamsters are pretty hardy pets. The issue is that if something goes wrong, the hamster is so small, it will be affected pretty quickly. Keep an eye out of an inactive hamster, not eating, diarrhea, hair loss, sneezing, or runny eyes. Some of these can be due to infections or even pneumonia. Try to keep your hamster warm and hydrated and speak to your vet about what to do.</br>

       A hamster escape is another common issue. If your hamster escapes, keep watch near the cage and then spread your search out to other rooms. Since they are nocturnal creatures, keep watch at night and check under and behind furniture. If possible, leave the cage open with plenty of food so the hamster can return on its own.
